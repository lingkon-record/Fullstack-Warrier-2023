   Ensure every <img> element has an alt attribute:
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Descriptive text here" />

   Make alt text meaningful and descriptive, conveying image content:
   <img src="..." alt="Concise and descriptive text" />

   Ensure alt text dynamically updates for interactive or changing images.

6. Use alt text for complex images:
   Provide detailed alt text for charts, diagrams, or complex images.
