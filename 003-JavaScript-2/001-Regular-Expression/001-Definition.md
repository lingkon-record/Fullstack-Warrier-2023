 Regular Expressions
A regular expression or RegExp is a small programming language that helps to find pattern in data. A RegExp can be used to check if some pattern exists in a different data types. To use RegExp in JavaScript either we use RegExp constructor or we can declare a RegExp pattern using two forward slashes followed by a flag. We can create a pattern in two ways.

To declare a string we use a single quote, double quote a backtick to declare a regular expression we use two forward slashes and an optional flag. The flag could be g, i, m, s, u or y.
