When to use Vue.js depends on your project's requirements. Consider Vue.js when:

You need to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.
Your team prefers a framework that's easy to learn and work with.
You want to build a single-page application (SPA) or need dynamic UI components within a larger application.
You value a well-documented and actively maintained framework.
You're working on a project where the simplicity and flexibility of Vue.js align with your goals.



However, remember that the choice of a framework ultimately depends on your project's specific needs
and your team's expertise. Other popular options like React and Angular are also worth considering,
depending on the situation.
